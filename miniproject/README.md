Bonku is a simple mobile application for documenting customer debts on a small scale (grocery shops). Users don't need to bother manually recording in the debt book. Bonku also provides statistical features for total debt and total debt owed by buyers. Users can create, read, update, and delete customers' data. For debt data, users are allowed to create, read, and delete data except to update them. I was inspired by the SAP software system, which is related to the accounting department, so not all transactions can be changed immediately. If a mistake occurs and you want to change transaction data, there are several options, one of them is to cancel the transaction and create a new transaction. I apply the same concept in Bonku app where the user must pay off debt data and create a new debt if there is a mistake while inputting debt data.
